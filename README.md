# MLP-Engage2Value-From-Clicks-to-Conversions
Predict purchase value from multi-session digital behaviour using ML.

# Description
The goal of this competition is to predict a customerâ€™s purchase value based on their multi-session behavior across digital touchpoints. The dataset captures anonymized user interactions such as browser types, traffic sources, device details, and geographical indicators. By modeling these patterns, participants will estimate the purchase potential of each user, helping optimize marketing and engagement strategies.

# Dataset Description
This dataset captures detailed session-level information from a large-scale digital commerce platform. Each row corresponds to a unique user session and includes data on user behavior, acquisition channels, device information, and geographical location.

We are expected to predict the purchaseValue, which represents the total amount spent during a given session.
